## Legitimacy of your solution

Any attempt to compromise the integrity of the contest will `unconditionally disqualify` your team. Therefore, please ensure you avoid attempting:

- Tampering with files in the `tests` folder or `config` folder.
- Hard coding values or logic to pass the test without solving the challenge legitimately.

## Improving your developer experience (Optional)

This step is not mandatory for working on the Hacktitude challenges, but it may improve your development experience. You can consider the following:

- Install a plugin for `SQLite` on your IDE so that you can explore the SQLite database.
- Install any other plugin that you find necessary to improve your developer experience.

* _Violation of the rules and regulations, or any attempt to gain an unfair advantage may result in disqualification._

* _Refrain from refreshing the page._

## Getting support

There will be minimal to no support available on the contest day. We are unable to clarify challenge descriptions on an individual basis. However, if you need help setting up the project, you may contact the **_technical support team_** via WhatsApp at the phone number `+94 74 354 6446`. Please note that no support for technical doubts will be provided. If we answer a question, we may share your question (anonymously) and our answer with all the team leaders via the common WhatsApp chat group where the team leaders will be added to in due course.

For **_non-technical support_**, you may reach out to our Malaysian Representative Anne Gomez at the number `+60 18 299 4076`, but please use calls only.
