## Legitimacy of your solution

Any attempt to compromise the integrity of the contest will `unconditionally disqualify` your team. Therefore, please ensure you avoid attempting:

- Tampering with files in the `tests` folder or `config` folder.
- Hard coding values or logic to pass the test without solving the challenge legitimately.

## Improving your developer experience (Optional)

This step is not mandatory for working on the Hacktitude challenges, but it may improve your development experience. You can consider the following:

- Install a plugin for **SQLite Viewer** on your IDE so that you can explore the SQLite database.
